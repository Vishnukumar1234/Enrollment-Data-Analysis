# Enrollment-Data-Analysis

Arizona State University Online Course Enrollment Data Analysis.

This repository contains the code and results of my personal data analysis project that explores the enrollment patterns of Arizona State University's Universal Learner Program online courses offered by the Learning Enterprise Department.

The main goal of this project was to gain insights into the questions such as:

* What are the most popular online courses  and how has their enrollment changed over different sessions?

* How do online course enrollments vary across different disciplines, levels, and modes of instruction?

* Are there any notable seasonal patterns in online course enrollments and Grade conversion?


To answer these questions, I cleaned, processed,analyzed and visualized them using Python and various data analysis libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Bokeh. The results of the analysis are presented in a Tableau using various visualizations, including line plots, bar, and pie charts.

This repository includes the following files and folders:

[Enrollment_Dataframe](/Enrollment_Dataframe.ipynb): is a Jupyter notebook file that documents the entire data analysis process, from data cleaning to visualization.

[Data](/Data): contains the raw and processed data files along with the various data cleaning reports found during the analysis.

[Dashboard](/Dashboard.twb) : contains the visualizations generated from the analysis.

[README.md](/README.md): this file.


Feel free to explore the code and visualizations and use them as a starting point for your own analysis of ASU's online course enrollment data. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
